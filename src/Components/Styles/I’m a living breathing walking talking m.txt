I’m a living breathing walking talking moving miracle
I’m a living breathing walking talking moving miracle
People said I’d never, they said I’d never ever but stop look watch

Cause I am, I am
Cause I am, I am

I heard (I heard)
You were (you were)
Wondering (wondering if God still answers prayer)

I heard (I heard)
That you were (that you were)
Searching for a sign (searching for a sign)
That He was still right there

(Put it up come on)
Every time you shake my hand oh yeah
Every time you see me dance oh yeah
You can tell by looking
But I ain’t got time to tell ya
All you really need to know is

I’m a living breathing walking talking moving miracle
I’m a living breathing walking talking moving miracle
People said I’d never, they said I’d never ever but stop look watch

Cause I am, I am
Cause I am, I am

So who are they compare to he
Who lives in me and knows all things
Greater is he than what you see
If you need proof just look at me

I’m a living breathing walking talking moving miracle
I’m a living breathing walking talking moving miracle
People said I’d never, they said I’d never ever but stop look watch

So who are they
Compare to he
Greater is he
Than what you see
Greater is he
Greater is he
Greater is he

Greater is he than what you see
If you believe just look at me
